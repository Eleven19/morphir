# Morphir Extension Development Kits (XDKs)

 **Morphir Extension Development Kits** - libraries for extending Morphir with a variety of programming languages. This is the extension side in a hosting model (or what is referred to as a "guest language" in WebAssembly Component Model). Put simply, an XDK allows you to build plugins to tools and/or runtimes. An XDK will provide the necessary APIs and interfaces to allow you to extend the Morphir ecosystem with your own custom functionality.
