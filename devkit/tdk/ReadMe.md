# Morphir Tooling Development Kit (TDK)

The Morphir Tooling Development Kit (TDK) is a collection of tools and libraries that help you build tools (such as CLIs) for working with Morphir models. The TDK includes:

- CLI tools - Command line tools for working with Morphir models.
- Libraries - Libraries for building your own CLI tools or other tools for working with Morphir models.

It should be noted that the TDK is **not** focused on the extension side of the Morphir ecosystem. For that, see the Morphir Extension Development Kit (XDK).
